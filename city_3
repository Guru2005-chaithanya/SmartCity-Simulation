1-Aim:
Design and simulate an applied Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Smart City in Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates:
intelligent street lighting (motion- / day-night controlled),
smart surveillance (webcam → tablet/controller, alerts), and
fire monitoring and automated sprinklers (sensor → MCU → actuator),
to demonstrate automated city monitoring, energy savings, and automatic safety response.

2 — Problem statement:
Urban areas need efficient, automated systems for public safety and energy optimization. Manually operated street lights and surveillance responses are slow and wasteful. This project simulates an IIoT solution that:
reduces power usage with motion/day-night street light control,
provides real-time video and motion alerts for surveillance,
detects fire and automatically activates sprinklers and alarms,
all implemented and demonstrated in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3 — Scope of the solution:
In-scope:
Simulation of multiple street lamps with motion/day-night logic.
Motion detectors and webcams feeding a local Home Gateway (IoT controller) and a tablet/PC dashboard.
Fire monitor sensor connected via MCU to trigger sprinkler and siren.
Logging/demo of alerts, status dashboard, and automated actuation.
Out-of-scope (for this assignment):
Real hardware deployment, real cloud integration, large-scale network HA/scale testing, advanced ML-based object detection.

4 — Required components (software + hardware used in simulation):
Software (for simulation & demo):
Cisco Packet Tracer (latest supported by your course)
Hardware (simulated in Packet Tracer):
IoT Home Gateway / DEC100 (Packet Tracer IoT Gateway)
Street Lamp (use IoT light / smart bulb available in Packet Tracer)
Motion Detector (IoT motion detector)
Webcam (IoT webcam)
Tablet/TabletPC (for dashboard)
Fire Monitor sensor (IoT fire sensor)
MCU-PT / Microcontroller (Arduino-like MCU in Packet Tracer)
Siren / Sprinkler (actuators in Packet Tracer)
Optional: Router + Switch + PC for logging server or remote dashboard
